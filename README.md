# Perfect Hit Prototype - Unity Game

This prototype was developed as part of a junior game developer test to recreate the core gameplay and user experience of the game "Perfect Hit" by Voodoo. The objective was to demonstrate playability, readability, satisfaction, and game feel within a limited time frame of 4 hours.
