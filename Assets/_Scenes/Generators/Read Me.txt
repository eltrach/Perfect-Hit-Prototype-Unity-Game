There is two scenes 
 - Level Generation By Changing Scale V0.1 NotFinished : in this scene i changed the level scale (width and length),
but the materiel doesn't look good enough , it stretches it
 - _Level Generation By Tiles Finished : in this scene i create a GroundTile Prefab and i generated based on the Lenght,
for the width i only change the scale i guess this method is better for good visuals...
 - _Level Generation : Final version .
